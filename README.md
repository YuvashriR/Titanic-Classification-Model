# 🚢 Titanic Classification Model  
### 👩‍💻 Project by: **Yuvashri Rajendran**

A Machine Learning classification model built to predict whether a passenger survived the **Titanic disaster** based on demographic and travel-related features.  
This mini-project demonstrates the complete ML workflow — data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation and prediction.

## 🧠 Project Goal
To build a prediction model that classifies passengers into **Survived / Not Survived** using historical dataset information.
